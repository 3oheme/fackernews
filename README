Fackernews! - fake hacker news generator

Just a silly Fake hacker news generator.

Q: How?

Quite simple and straightforward recipe:

1.- Take a list of news from some old database.
2.- In another bowl, create lists of different items â€” Companies, tools, browsers...
3.- Program a stupid script to load a random new and try to change any occurrence
    of a string for any other item of that list.
4.- Thats all. Sometimes is funny, others just silly.

Sorry, no IA, no language processing, no neuronal networks.

Q: Why?

A: Two reasons: First of all because sometimes it looks like that all hacker
news are always the same, just changing some company/app/version/lang. And
also because I think it can be also sort of inspirational think, connecting
different subjects and creating new and - sometimes interesting - news.
